Parking Lot Design 

An apartment has 3 wings (wing-A, wing-B, wing C) with 10 floor each (9 residential floors and ground floor is dedicated for parking 
vehicles). On each floor there are 4 flats (building capacity: 3*9*4=108).It has three parking levels such that Level A dedicated for 
wing –A , Level B for wing – B and so on. Each parking level has multiple compact and large spots.  

Parking Condition: Two-wheelers can be parked in any spots. Four-wheelers can be parked in one large spot or two consecutive compact spots.
 
Details need to be stored: 
 Parking_Lot details to store parking spots information like Parking_level, dedicated_wing, no_of_compact_spots, no_of_large_spots, 
status_compactspots(array storing which spots are occupied or not), status_large_spots(array storing which spots are occupied or not).  
Flat_Details to store floor and wings details like wing_id, flat_id, no_of_two_wheelers,  no_of_four_wheelers. 

Write a program to implement following functions- 
1. Add_or_map_vehicle_Node() : whenever new vehicle is purchased by flat owner it should be added to corresponding parking spot as per
parking condition given above. If any flat occupant cannot get parking spots in their respective parking level then remaining parking 
levels in order (i.e. if A is full then first B is searched and then C) should be taken into consideration. If any occupant has more 
than 1 four wheeler then only one large spot should be allocated in parking level dedicated to wing and others should be allocated other 
than dedicated parking level. This function will map permanent parking spot to flat owner vehicles but their status will not be allocated 
all time. At the end this function should display vehicle mapping status for all levels in tree representation. 

2. Write a function Park_vehicle () which will allocate mapped parking spot to vehicle just by reading vehicle number. 
Note:   If the vehicle number is not mapped with any parking spot then it is considered as guest vehicle. In such cases any free spot 
depending on vehicle type will be allocated.  For mapped vehicle if the spot is not free, then first free spot in any parking level can be 
allocated (but the search should start with vehicle owners dedicated parking level).  This function should keep track on date, time, inside
rs and visitors, vehicle number for visitors. 

3. Remove_vehicle_node (): if any flat owner sells his vehicle then corresponding entry from parking tree should be removed. 

4. Write a function Display_Visitors() to get all visitors on particular date along with their vehicle type and number and parking level , 
parking spot details. 

5. Write a function Parking_status () to display the list of free and allocated parking spots in each parking level.
